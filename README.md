## ⚡ About Me

I build offensive tooling that automates chaos across Web2, Web3, and AI/ML attack surfaces.

I chased all three like a rabid dog, got lost in the noise. Now I’m laser-focused on **Web2 and AI** — crafting precise, modular tooling that punches through real systems. No filler. No theory. Just red team code that *bleeds*.

Everything I build feeds into **[Hydrapulse](#-hydrapulse--my-red-team-automation-platform)** — my personal automation system engineered to hunt, exploit, and exfiltrate.

## ⚔️ Hydrapulse — My Red Team Automation Platform

> Multi-headed beast engineered for autonomous red teaming across three verticals.

- 🕸️ **Web2 Head** — Misconfig shredding, IDOR chains, stealthy recon.
- 🔗 **Web3 Head** — Contract breakage, DeFi logic bugs, protocol chaos.
- 🧠 **AI/ML Head** — Jailbreaks, model fuzzing, adversarial inputs, and attack chaining.

Hydrapulse isn’t just a toolkit — it’s a f*cking war engine. Under active development.
