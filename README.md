## ⚡ About Me

I build offensive tooling that automates chaos across Web2, Web3, and AI/ML attack surfaces.

I chased all three like a rabid dog, got lost in the noise. Now I’m laser-focused on **Web2 and AI** — crafting precise, modular tooling that punches through real systems. No filler. No theory. Just red team code that *bleeds*.

Everything I build feeds into **[Hydrapulse](#-hydrapulse--my-red-team-automation-platform)** — my personal automation system engineered to hunt, exploit, and exfiltrate.
